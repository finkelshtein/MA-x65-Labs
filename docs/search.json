One can either define needed functions or use the functions defined in external libraries (packages).\n\n\nHow to define a function\n\n\nWe start with defining a new function. For example, consider the function which returns, for two variables, the difference of their squares. Let’s call this function sq_diff.\n\n\nsq_diff &lt;- function(x,y) {\n    x**2 - y**2    \n}\n\nThen we can use anywhere below, e.g.\n\nsq_diff(4,5)\n\n[1] -9\n\n\n\nNote that a more formal way to define this function would be\n\n\nsq_diff &lt;- function(x,y) {\n    ans &lt;- x**2 - y**2    \n    return(ans)\n}\n\nThe function may contain any number of the code lines.\n\nIn particular, the code inside a function may call another function. For example, the build-in R function sin takes arguments in radians:\n\n\nsin(pi/6)\n\n[1] 0.5\n\n\nLet’s define another function which arguments in degrees, recall that \\(180^\\circ\\) is \\(\\pi\\) radians, i.e. \\(x^\\circ\\) is \\(\\dfrac{x}{180}\\pi\\) radians. Then we can write\n\nsindeg &lt;- function(x){\n    sin(pi*x/180)\n}\n\nand then we can use it:\n\nsindeg(30)\n\n[1] 0.5"

R distinguishes the name of the argument and the argument itself. For example, in the defined above function sindeg the argument is called x. So we can specify the argument (though it’s not needed here since it’s the only argument):\n\nsindeg(x = 30)\n\n[1] 0.5\n\n\nNow, imagine we have a variable in our program which is also called x. Then we can write inside the function x = x:\n\nx &lt;- 30\nsindeg(x = x)\n\n[1] 0.5\n\n\nR will understand that, in x = x the left x is the name of the argument of function sindeg, whereas the right x is the variable defined earlier.\n\n\nHow to use an external package\n\n\nIt is not surprising that such functions were also created by other people. Such additional function are combined in packages. Each package should be first installed in R Studio and then loaded in R programme (in R-file).\nNote that each package should be installed only once, but it should be loaded in any R-file where it is used.\nWe can install package flexsurv which contains functions dweibullPH, pweibullPH, qweibullPH, rweibullPH, hweibullPH which use parametrisation Equation 3. (This package also contains many other useful functions, of course.) To install this package, use menu Tools in R Studio, and select the first item Install Packages... Then you type the package name flexsurv and press Install.\nAfter this, we write in the code (only once in the Lab file!) library(flexsurv) and then we can use e.g. dweibullPH. For example,\n\n\nalpha = 0.76\nbeta = 0.25\nsigma = alpha**(-1/beta)\ndweibull(1, shape=beta, scale=sigma)\n\n[1] 0.08885662\n\n\ncoincides with\n\nlibrary(flexsurv)\ndweibullPH(1, shape=beta, scale=alpha)\n\n[1] 0.08885662"
